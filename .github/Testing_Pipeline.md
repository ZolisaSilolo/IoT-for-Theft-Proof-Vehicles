# Python Application with Automated Testing Pipeline

This repository contains a Python application with an integrated continuous integration (CI) pipeline that automatically runs tests and performs code quality checks. The project emphasizes code quality and testing best practices through automated workflows, making it easier to maintain high-quality Python code.

The repository features a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically validates code changes by running linting checks and unit tests. This ensures that all code contributions maintain consistent quality standards and don't introduce regressions. The workflow runs on Python 3.12.2 and utilizes industry-standard tools like flake8 for code quality checks and pytest for testing.

## Repository Structure
```

└── requirements.txt          # Project dependencies (optional)
```

## Usage Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.2 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# MacOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install flake8 pytest
# If requirements.txt exists
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start
1. Ensure your code follows the project's quality standards by running the linter:
```bash
flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
```

2. Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest
```

### More Detailed Examples
Running specific test files:
```bash
pytest path/to/test_file.py
```

Running flake8 with detailed output:
```bash
flake8 . --count --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
```

### Troubleshooting
#### Common Issues
1. **Python Version Mismatch**
   - Problem: `Invalid Python version`
   - Solution: Ensure Python 3.12.2 is installed:
     ```bash
     python --version
     # If needed, install the correct version from python.org
     ```

2. **Dependencies Installation Failure**
   - Problem: `Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement`
   - Solution: Update pip and try installing dependencies again:
     ```bash
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Test Discovery Issues**
   - Problem: `pytest` not finding test files
   - Solution: Ensure test files are named with `test_` prefix:
     ```bash
     # Correct naming
     test_example.py
     ```

#### Debugging
- Enable verbose pytest output:
  ```bash
  pytest -v --debug
  ```
- Show local variables in test failures:
  ```bash
  pytest -l
  ```

## Data Flow
The application implements a CI/CD pipeline that processes code changes through quality checks and testing phases.

```ascii
[Code Changes] -> [GitHub Actions] -> [Linting (flake8)] -> [Testing (pytest)] -> [Results]
                                           |                         |
                                           v                         v
                                    Code Quality Report         Test Results
```

Key component interactions:
1. GitHub Actions triggers on push or pull request to main branch
2. Python environment is set up with version 3.12.2
3. Dependencies are installed from requirements.txt if present
4. Flake8 performs code quality checks with specific rule sets
5. Pytest runs the test suite and reports results
6. The workflow fails if either linting or tests fail

## Infrastructure
The repository uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD infrastructure:

**Workflow Resources:**
- Runner: Ubuntu Latest
- Python Environment: 3.12.2
- Permissions: Read-only repository access

**Tools:**
- flake8: Code quality and style checker
- pytest: Testing framework
- pip: Package management

## Deployment

### Technical Requirements
- Python 3.12.2 or higher
- Ubuntu Latest (recommended for production)
- Minimum 1GB RAM
- 1GB disk space
- Network access for package installation

### Deployment Steps
1. **Pre-deployment Checks**
   ```bash
   # Verify Python version
   python --version
   
   # Check available disk space
   df -h
   
   # Verify network connectivity
   ping python.org
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create production environment
   python -m venv prod_env
   source prod_env/bin/activate
   
   # Install production dependencies
   pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Application Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Run tests in production environment
   pytest
   
   # Start the application (modify based on your entry point)
   python app.py
   ```

### Monitoring Setup
1. **Logging Configuration**
   - Configure logging in your Python application:
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(
       filename='app.log',
       level=logging.INFO,
       format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
   )
   ```

2. **Health Checks**
   - Implement basic health check endpoints
   - Monitor system resources using standard tools:
   ```bash
   # Monitor CPU and memory
   top
   
   # Monitor disk usage
   df -h
   
   # Monitor logs
   tail -f app.log
   ```

### Backup Procedures
1. **Database Backup** (if applicable)
   ```bash
   # Example backup command
   pg_dump database_name > backup.sql
   ```

2. **Code Backup**
   ```bash
   # Create a backup of the application
   tar -czf backup.tar.gz ./
   ```

### Risk Management
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Python Version Compatibility | High | Low | Regular testing with multiple Python versions |
| Dependency Conflicts | Medium | Medium | Use virtual environments and pin dependency versions |
| Resource Exhaustion | High | Low | Implement monitoring and auto-scaling |

### Rollback Procedures
1. Stop the application
2. Activate previous version's environment
3. Restore from backup if necessary
